# Amazons-Board-Game


Game instruction 
1. This is an extended version of board game "The Amazons" 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Amazons).
2. The game is played on chess-like board, but the size of the board is not fixed. Moreover, there 
can be treasure or some artifact on each field of the board. The game can be played by one, two 
or more players. Each player has a given number of amazons.
3. The game starts with the setting phase played in turns. In a single turn the current player places 
one of his amazons on an unoccupied field. Then, the next player does the same. This steps arerepeated until all amazons are placed. Players do not get treasures of artefacts during that phase,however the treasure and artifacts are removed from the used fields.
4. Game is played in turns. In his turn the player moves one of his amazons one or more fields in a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Then, the moved amazon shoots an arrow in a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally at least at distance of one field. Neither amazon nor the arrow can cross or enter a field with another amazon or any other landed arrow.
5. When the player cannot make a valid move then his turn is skipped. Game ends when all players have no valid move. 
6. After moving the amazon, the player collects the treasure and the artifact from the field where the amazon landed. The treasure can be worth from 1 to 5. The artifact must be used immediately.
7. The winner is the player who gets the most treasure. 
8. The artifacts are as follows:
a) a horse - the amazon immediately does the next move
b) a broken arrow - the amazon does NOT shoot an arrow after moving 
c) a spear - instead of shooting an arrow, the amazon throws a spear; No obstacle blocks the 
throw, so the spear can literally land on any field with no amazon or arrow and the field 
becomes an obstacle, like in case of arrow. The spear can be moved only horizontally, 
vertically or diagonally
